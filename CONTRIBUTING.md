# Welcome to emnify Documentations contributing guide

Your interest in contributing to the emnify Documentation is greatly appreciated.
By helping maintain and grow our documentation, your efforts will not only benefit your own organization but the greater emnify community as well.

It is assumed that contributors, both internal and external, have some understanding of basic [Git](https://git-scm.com/) concepts.
[GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) provides the essentials for collaborating on projects hosted in GitHub.

If you haven't worked with [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) before, here are some resources to help you get started:

- [Basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
- [Extended syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)
- [Markup reference for GitHub Docs](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/content-markup-reference.md) used in GitHub documents and comments
- [Docusaurus Markdown Features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features) used in creating content for the emnify Documentation site

## Updating the documentation

If you don't already have a GitHub account, you will need to [sign up](https://github.com/signup) for one.
Once you have a GitHub account and have logged in, you will be able to contribute.

Starting from the emnify Documentation [document root](https://github.com/EMnify/product-docs/tree/main/docs) directory, find the file you wish to edit.

If you haven't already forked the [emnify/product-docs](https://github.com/EMnify/product-docs) repository, GitHub will do it for you as soon as you select the edit icon.

Once the page updates with the message that your GitHub has **create a fork of this project** (see above) you can scroll down to find the text you wish to edit.

## Creating new content

For adding a new page to the documentation find the appropriate place and choose **Add file**.
In the following example, we want to add a new device to the Quickstart guide.

----

----

Selecting **Create new file** opens the editor and prompts you to give your new file a name:

----

----

When your new contribution is ready, scroll to the bottom to provide a description and choose **Propose new file**.

----

----

You will then be able to create the pull request.
The remaining steps are the same as above for [creating a pull request](#creating-a-pull-request) with editing exiting content.

## Previewing the documentation site

For larger contributions, especially when adding new pages, it becomes necessary to preview how the new content will look when rendered as HTML, and how it will fit it in with the existing documentation.
