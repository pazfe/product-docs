# Creating a device

After you register a SIM, you need to create a virtual representation of the device associated with the SIM.
To create a device, give it a name and assign a service and coverage policy.

import AddDevice from './assets/portal-connected-devices-add-device.png';

<div class="medium-zoom-image">
  <img src={AddDevice} style={{width:1010}} alt="Connected Devices: Add Device" />
</div>

If you plan on using your device right away, activate it. If you do not plan on using the device right away, select **Leave Disabled**.
