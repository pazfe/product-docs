# Getting the first device online

Any device equipped with a SIM card requires an Access Point Name (APN) configuration to establish a data session.
Some devices and networks auto-detect the APN but for most cases you need to configure it.

[APN](/glossary#apn---access-point-name): `em` (or alternatively use `emnify`)

Further, some Android / iOS-based devices and cellular modules also need to be configured to allow for roaming.

Select your device type and model to see how to configure the APN:

- [iOS devices](ios-devices)
- [Cellular modules](cellular-modules)
- [GPS trackers](gps-trackers)
- [Industrial routers](industrial-routers)
