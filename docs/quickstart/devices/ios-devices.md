When setting up an iOS device with an emnify IoT SIM you need to follow 4 steps

1. Go to **Settings** → **Mobile Data**
1. Select `emnify` under **DATA PLANS** (first one if regular SIM or secondary in case of eSIM)
1. Enable **Data Roaming** and tap on Mobile Data Network
1. Set APN to `em` - leave everything else blank
