*Applies to FMB110, FMB120, FM130, FMB140, FMC001, FMM001, FMC125, FMC130, FMC640, FMM125, FMM130, FMM640, FMP100, FMB001, FMB002, FMB003, FMB010*

Configuring the APN for Teltonika GPS trackers can be done through:

Newer Teltonika GPS versions automatically detect the emnify APN setting.

When the GPS tracker is turned on for the first time after the SIM is installed, it shows the status **Attached** in the emnify Portal.
At this point, the device can receive SMS but not establish a data session unless the APN is set up or detected.

If you've set a username and password for the device, use the following SMS command to set the APN (replacing `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` with your credentials):

```
USERNAME PASSWORD setparam 2001:em
```

Otherwise, if there's no username or password configured, use the following:

```
  setparam 2001:em
```

:::caution
The two leading spaces are required.
