# Registering SIMs

Once you get your emnify SIMs, you need to register them before you can start using them.
If you order the free Evaluation SIM package, you will have to register each of the 3 SIMs separately.

1. Login to your [emnify account](https://portal.emnify.com).  
1. From the **GET STARTED** menu, select [Register SIM(s)](https://portal.emnify.com/sim-registration)
