# Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up SSO, use the following suggestions to help troubleshoot.

## Microsoft Active Directory

- Are you part of the Azure Tenant?
- Do you see a "User canceled social login" message? Make sure the [application registration is set to **Multitenant**](microsoft-active-directory#sso-with-microsoft).

## General

- Are you part of the emnify enterprise?
- Is your user account enabled on emnify?

If everything looks correct and you still have issues, try again using an incognito tab. 

You can also [contact support](https://support.emnify.com/).
